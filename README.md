# Technical Details
## JavaScript
The game logic is implemented in script.js file. The script generates a random number using Math.random() function and converts it to an integer using Math.trunc() function. The score variable keeps track of the player's score and is initialized to 20. The highScore variable keeps track of the player's highest score and is initialized to 0.
The addEventListener() function is used to add event listeners to the .check and .again elements. The click event is used to listen for clicks on the elements. When the .check element is clicked, the script checks the player's guess and updates the game state accordingly. When the .again element is clicked, the game is reset.
