# Game Design
The game has a simple design that is easy to use and understand. The user interface consists of a number input, a check button, and a reset button. The game also includes a message area that displays messages to the user, such as whether their guess was too high or too low. The game's background color changes depending on whether the user wins or loses the game. When the user wins the game, the game displays a congratulatory message and the user's score. When the user loses the game, the game displays a message telling the user they lost and the correct number. The game also keeps track of the user's highest score, which is displayed after each game.

# Technical Details
## JavaScript
The game logic is implemented in script.js file. The script generates a random number using Math.random() function and converts it to an integer using Math.trunc() function. The score variable keeps track of the player's score and is initialized to 20. The highScore variable keeps track of the player's highest score and is initialized to 0.
The addEventListener() function is used to add event listeners to the .check and .again elements. The click event is used to listen for clicks on the elements. When the .check element is clicked, the script checks the player's guess and updates the game state accordingly. When the .again element is clicked, the game is reset.
## HTML
The index.html file contains the structure of the game. The .message element is used to display messages to the player. The .good element is used to display a message to the player when they win the game. The .score element is used to display the player's current score. The .hidgscore element is used to display the player's highest score. The .guess element is used to get the player's guess. The .check element is used to check the player's guess. The .again element is used to reset the game. The .number element is used to display the correct number when the player wins the game.
